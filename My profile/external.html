        A startup or start-up is a company or project undertaken by an entrepreneur to seek, develop, and validate a
        scalable business model.[1][2] While entrepreneurship includes all new businesses including self-employment and
        businesses that do not intend to go public, startups are new businesses that intend to grow large beyond the
        solo-founder.[3] During the beginning, startups face high uncertainty[4] and have high rates of failure, but a
        minority of them do go on to become successful and influential, such as unicorns.[5]

    <p class="para">
        Startups typically begin by a founder (solo-founder) or co-founders who have a way to solve a problem. The
        founder of a startup will do the market validation by problem interview, solution interview, and building a
        minimum viable product (MVP), i.e. a prototype, to develop and validate their business models. The startup
        process can take a long period of time; hence, sustaining effort is required. Over the long term, sustaining
        effort is especially challenging because of the high failure rates and uncertain outcomes.[6] Having a business
        plan in place outlines what to do and how to plan and achieve an idea in the future. Typically, these plans
        outline the first three to five years of your business strategy.[7]

        Market validation
    </h2>
    <p class="para1">
        A key principle of startup is to validate the market need before providing a customer-centric product or service
        to avoid business ideas with weak demand.[14] Market validation can be done in a number of ways, including
        surveys, cold calling, email responses, word of mouth or through sample research.[15]
