                The Indian gaming industry is at a nascent stage but is expected to grow significantly in the coming
                years. In the last 15 years, India has witnessed considerable economic growth. This, in addition to its
                demographic structure, offers immense potential for the gaming industry. An amalgamation of our culture,
                rising urban incomes, education, IT development and telecom growth offer the perfect platform for the
                gaming industry. IT and telecom considerably drive the gaming industry. One of the segments with highest
                growth is the console gaming industry which is capturing higher market share year on year.

                While the global gaming industry is growing at 22 per cent, the Indian gaming industry is valued at Rs
                13 billion and is expected to grow to Rs 38 billion by 2015 [2] . India offers a huge pool of talent in
                the IT and programming sector which plays a substantial role in the development of quality games at
                reasonably lower costs. Additionally, while the gaming industry is picking up, serious players and
                investors are entering into the industry, consequently facilitating its further growth.
